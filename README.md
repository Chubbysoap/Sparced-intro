# Sparced-intro
#  Pan cancer <h6> To entirely understand what the SPARCED model is, it is best learn what it came from.  This would be the PAN cancer model.  The official paper can be found here   This is a mechanistic model of Cancer in a MCF10A cell, which is a non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line.  The model is an "integrated system of ordinary differential equations"  which was coded in MATLAB, and buttressed by CVODES, a software library that aids with the solving of ordinary differential equations.  Now how will a simulation help further our understanding of cancer?  Well, the claim is that this "model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.‚Äù  So data can be collected from designed situations, a revolutionary advancement.  We can be prepared for an event that has not yet occurred.  Normally a real person has to have cancer for data to be collected, which has lots of constraints.  
# How is the sparced model laid out <h6> The design is heirachical.  It is a large model made of many smaller models, one from many.  This allows for incremental improvements, until the model is as comprehensive as it needs to be.
